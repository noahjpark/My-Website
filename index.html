              <p>
                As someone who is fascinated by algorithms and data structures, 
                I wanted to create a way to visualize them. For this project, 
                I focused on the sorting subset of algorithms. There are 14 
                different sorting algorithms that can be visualized on a variety 
                of array sizes and speeds. The link redirects to the React web 
                application hosted through GitHub pages. The source code can be found on my GitHub.

              <p>As a teaching assistant, I took the initiative to stop plagiarism and protect 
                the integrity of the University of Minnesota. To do this, I utilized the MOSS
                open source system publicly available from Stanford University. To generate a 
                report of all relevant information on plagiarism from student submissions, 
                I had to provide the MOSS script with the directory of student submissions. 
                Creating this directory manually was largely time consuming, so I decided to 
                write a script to automate the process of creating and populating the submission 
                directory. The source code can be found on my GitHub.

                  I was been a teaching assistant for the following courses: Introduction to Computing and Programming, Introduction to Algorithms and Data
                  Structures, Discrete Structures of Computer Science, and Machine Architecture and Organization. As a teaching assistant, I helped refine and write labs
                  and projects that were to be assigned to students. Along with three fellow teaching assistants, we ran a lab of 30-40 students where students would work
                  on problems to advance the required knowledge of the course. On rotation, I would lead the lab myself where I would speak in front of the lab at start time
                  to give a concise introduction to what would be required in the lab. Outside of labs, I held office hours where students would come for help on class material,
                  projects, assignments, or whatever else they needed assistance with. On numerous occassions, I was given personal from more than twenty different students that felt I had made
                  a difference in their learning. To assist the professor, the teaching assistants would help grade projects, assignments, tests, or whatever was assigned to
                  the students. In addition, I was awarded and recognized four times by the department of Computer Science for outstanding teaching.

                <h1>The Home Depot</h1>
                <p>
                  I was hired as a cashier for my local Home Depot where I provided excellent customer support and security on the front-end of the store. I had the responsibilities of
                  handling cash registers, working directly with customers to fulfill their needs, and ensure the security of the front-end when patrons left the store. I was successfully
                  able to de-escalate situations where conflict occurred and was able to protect the stock of the store on multiple different occassions. As the last face the customer would
                  see before leaving our store, I provided a friendly face with quick checkout and ensured the customers left the store feeling better than when they came in.
